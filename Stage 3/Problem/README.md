# Stage 3 - Things Become More Real

This is already getting close to a real project. In this stage we have:
- A header-only library, defining an interface.
- A library with an implementation to that interface.
- A main executable using the implementation.

Of course, the implemtation library and main executable have their corresponding unittests, and this time, they're compiled with googletest, so in actuality, we have 3 libraries and 1 executable.
